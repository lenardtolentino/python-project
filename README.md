# Project Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset to gain insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior. 
The analysis is performed using Python, specifically the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.
The dataset is first cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency, 
followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
